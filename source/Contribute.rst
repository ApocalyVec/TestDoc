Run from source
*********************

RealityNavigation App requires python3.8+. Clone the project from `RealityNavigation's repo page <https://github.com/ApocalyVec/RenaLabApp>`_.

Navigation to the root folder of the downloaded repo, install all the prerequisites with the following command::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Run main.py to start the app::

   python main.py

Notes for working with PyQt
---------------------------------

Threading
^^^^^^^^^

When creating QThread, you must always not let the QThread to be garbage-collected while the thread is active. One way
of doing this is to save the thread's reference to be a permanent object's attribute, like a GUI controller, like::

    Class MyGUIWidget(QtWidgets.QWidget):
        ...

        def start_a_thread(self):
            thread: QThread = create_a_thread()
            thread.start()

The above code would cause the program to silently crash, because the thread object is garbage-collected after the function
returns. Instead do::

    Class MyGUIWidget(QtWidgets.QWidget):
        ...

        def start_a_thread(self):
            self.thread: QThread = create_a_thread()
            self.thread.start()

, by saving the thread object to a permanent attribute, the thread object will not be garbage-collected and lives with
the GUI controller object.

If you would like to add contents to PhysioLabXR's documentation, you can follow these instructions
on how to make changes and compile them:

1.Fork the the `RealityNavigationDocs repo <https://github.com/ApocalyVec/RealityNavigationDocs>`_.
2.Clone the forked repo to your local directory:

   .. code-block::

       git clone https://github.com/<GitHubUserName>/RealityNavigationDocs

3.Go to <PathToTheClonedRepo>/source, where you can edit existing pages or add new pages. You could include a new
page in "Further Information" in index.rst for easier navigation.

4.Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo and install the packages need for compiling the webpage

   .. code-block::

        pip install -r requirements.txt

5.In the root directory of the project, compile the html using the command

* MacOS/Linux:

   .. code-block::

        make html
* Windows:

   .. code-block::

        ./make.bat html

6.View your changes by opening <PathToTheClonedRepo>/build/html/index.html.

7.Submit your changes by creating a pull request in GitHub. Read `this entry <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_
on how to create pull request from fork.
